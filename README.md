# PyramidSolitaire
This is a Pyramid Solitaire game that I've created in IntelliJ. 

Rules of the Game:

- The game can only be played with a full deck of 52
- If you reach a score of 0 you win.
- The current score is the sum of the value of all cards visible in the pyramid.
- You can remove one or two cards if they are exposed and their values add up to 13. 
- Exposed cards have no card underneath them. 
- You can either remove 1 card, remove two cards, discard draw a card, or remove a draw and a pyramid card.
- Type your move: rm1, rm2, dd, or rmwd 
- Then input the coordinate of the card (row, card) in the pyramid.
- If you remove all card from the pyramid you win.
- If you run out of moves, the game ends.
