Changes:

- I fixed my getRowWidth method (returns the size of the row instead of (row + 1))
- I added a helper method to remove in Basic and Relaxed
- the helper above is called isValidValueAndSet
- I added tests for correctly starting the game after it has been called
- To make sure startGame resets the game after the call I cleared every field of Basic everytime I call startGame
