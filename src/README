Changes:

- I fixed my isGameOver() method
- I added tests for isGameOver() method
- I also fixed my getDraw method, I used to return a mutable list but now its a copy so it canâ€™t be changed for cheating
- I caught an index out of bounds exception in my remove method
- I more general tests for BasicPyramidSolitaire class
- I improved my Card class by making fields private
- I organized the toString for Card class
